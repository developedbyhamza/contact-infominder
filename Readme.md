## Technical Details

> Custom API or backend built with Express, NodeJS and MongoDB database is used alongwith the frontend built with ReactJS.

### Database Setup

- For database, I used a MongoDB which is a NoSQL Database (Document Database having JSON format).
- For easy setup, I used MongoDB Atlas which is a cloud database.

## Usage

Install dependencies

```
npm install
npm client-install
```

### Mongo connection setup

Edit your /config/default.json file to include the correct MongoDB URI

```
npm run dev     # Express & React :3000 & :5000
npm run server  # Express API Only :5000
npm run client  # React Client Only :3000
```
